# ðŸ§¾ PDFTextStripper

**PDFTextStripper** is a lightweight Python utility that removes *only the text layer* from PDF files â€” while preserving **images, colors, vector drawings, and overall structure**.  

Unlike most PDF "cleaning" tools that rasterize or flatten the document (destroying quality), this script intelligently redacts and deletes the text stream using **PyMuPDF (fitz)** redaction annotations, ensuring that the visual content remains completely intact.

## Features

- âœ… Removes **all text** while keeping **graphics, shapes, and images** untouched  
- âœ… Preserves **original PDF structure and layers**  
- âœ… Fast and memory-efficient (stream-based processing)  
- âœ… Simple to use and modify  
- âœ… No external dependencies except PyMuPDF

## How It Works (Detailed Logic)

This script uses **PyMuPDF**â€™s low-level PDF parsing and redaction API to selectively remove only text blocks from each page.

### Step-by-Step Logic:

1. **Open the PDF:**
   ```python
   doc = fitz.open(input_pdf)

The file is loaded into a `fitz.Document` object, allowing direct access to all pages and content streams.

2. **Iterate through pages:**

   ```python
   for page_num in range(len(doc)):
       page = doc[page_num]
   ```

   Each page is processed individually.

3. **Extract text structure:**

   ```python
   blocks = page.get_text("rawdict")
   ```

   The `"rawdict"` mode provides a dictionary of all content blocks (text, images, paths, etc.), with exact coordinates (`bbox`) and type information.

4. **Detect and mark text blocks:**

   ```python
   if b["type"] == 0:  # text block
       page.add_redact_annot(b["bbox"])
   ```

   Each text block is tagged for redaction using its bounding box.
   This does **not yet remove text**, it just *marks it*.

5. **Apply redactions:**

   ```python
   page.apply_redactions(images=fitz.PDF_REDACT_IMAGE_NONE)
   ```

   This command finalizes the redaction process:

   * All marked text is permanently deleted.
   * Images, vectors, and colors remain untouched.
   * The visual layout of the page is fully preserved.

6. **Save the cleaned PDF:**

   ```python
   doc.save(output_pdf, deflate=True, garbage=4)
   ```

   The result is written to disk efficiently, with optional compression and garbage collection to minimize file size.

## Why This Works Better

Most PDF cleaning tools either:

* **Rasterize** the page (convert to image â†’ loses quality), or
* **Flatten** content (merging layers â†’ loses editability), or
* **Strip streams** blindly (removes shapes and images too).

`PDFTextStripper` uniquely leverages **PyMuPDFâ€™s redaction API**, which is natively supported by the PDF spec â€” making this a *non-destructive*, *standards-compliant*, and *high-fidelity* approach.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Place your `input.pdf` in the project directory.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python remove_text.py
   ```
3. The cleaned PDF will be saved as `output_cleaned.pdf`.
